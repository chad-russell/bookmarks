# Feature Specification: Bookmark Manager Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web app that is a bookmark manager - a folder structure with arbitrary nested subfolders, and bookmarks within them that are just links to web pages. Should allow for a traditional file tree view, as well as a view that shows sections with nice tiles. Similar to how Finder works on macos, where you can see multiple types of views of the same structure. All state should be kept in a single flat file, for easy backup and easy config generation. Each bookmark should hold a URL and an image URL. If image URL blank, the image should just be the favicon of the webpage."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to organize my bookmarks into a nested folder structure so that I can easily find them later. I want to be able to view my bookmarks as a simple list or as a grid of tiles for a more visual experience. I also want to be able to easily back up my bookmarks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I have the application open, **When** I create a new folder, **Then** it appears in the folder tree.
2.  **Given** I have a folder selected, **When** I add a new bookmark with a URL, **Then** the bookmark appears inside that folder.
3.  **Given** I am viewing a folder with bookmarks, **When** I switch to the tile view, **Then** the bookmarks are displayed as a grid of tiles.
4.  **Given** a bookmark does not have an image URL, **When** it is displayed, **Then** the favicon of the bookmarked page is shown.
5.  **Given** I have made changes to my bookmarks, **When** I check the flat file, **Then** my changes are reflected in the file.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens when a URL is invalid?
-   What happens when a favicon for a URL cannot be fetched?
-   How does the system handle very deep folder nesting?
-   What happens if the flat file is corrupted or malformed?
