# Feature Specification: Bookmark Manager Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web app that is a bookmark manager - a folder structure with arbitrary nested subfolders, and bookmarks within them that are just links to web pages. Should allow for a traditional file tree view, as well as a view that shows sections with nice tiles. Similar to how Finder works on macos, where you can see multiple types of views of the same structure. All state should be kept in a single flat file, for easy backup and easy config generation. Each bookmark should hold a URL and an image URL. If image URL blank, the image should just be the favicon of the webpage."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want a beautiful, modern, and minimal application to organize my bookmarks into a nested folder structure. I want to interact with my bookmarks through a sleek, themeable interface that works flawlessly on both my desktop and phone. The application's state should be stored in a single file that I can directly edit, with any changes I make being reflected in the app, and vice-versa, ensuring my data is always in sync and easy to manage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I have the application open, **When** I create a new folder using the UI, **Then** it appears in the folder tree and is saved to the flat file.
2.  **Given** I have a folder selected, **When** I add a new bookmark with a URL, **Then** the bookmark appears inside that folder and is saved to the flat file.
3.  **Given** I manually edit the flat file to add a new bookmark, **When** I reload the application, **Then** the new bookmark is displayed.
4.  **Given** I am viewing the application on a desktop, **When** I resize the window to a mobile screen size, **Then** the layout adjusts to a single-column, responsive view.
5.  **Given** the application supports multiple themes, **When** I switch from the default theme to another, **Then** the application's color scheme and appearance updates instantly.
6.  **Given** I am viewing a folder with bookmarks, **When** I switch to the tile view, **Then** the bookmarks are displayed as a grid of tiles.
7.  **Given** a bookmark does not have an image URL, **When** it is displayed, **Then** the favicon of the bookmarked page is shown.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens when a URL is invalid?
-   What happens when a favicon for a URL cannot be fetched?
-   How does the system handle very deep folder nesting?
-   What happens if the flat file is corrupted or malformed?
-   What happens if the file is edited by both the UI and an external editor simultaneously? The last write wins; this is an unsupported edge case.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
-   **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create, rename, and delete folders via the UI.
-   **FR-002**: System MUST allow folders to be nested within other folders to an arbitrary depth.
-   **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and delete bookmarks within folders via the UI.
-   **FR-004**: Each bookmark MUST store a URL and an optional image URL.
-   **FR-005**: System MUST provide a file tree view to navigate the folder structure.
-   **FR-006**: System MUST provide a tile view to display bookmarks within a folder.
-   **FR-007**: If a bookmark's image URL is not provided, the system MUST attempt to fetch and display the favicon of the webpage.
-   **FR-008**: All application state (folders and bookmarks) MUST be persisted in a single, flat file, which serves as the single source of truth.
-   **FR-009**: Changes made in the UI MUST be immediately saved to the flat file.
-   **FR-010**: The application MUST be able to reload and reflect any changes made directly to the flat file.
-   **FR-011**: The application's UI MUST be modern, beautiful, and minimal, modeled after Vercel/shadcn design standards.
-   **FR-012**: The application MUST be themeable and include a pre-defined set of themes.
-   **FR-013**: The application's layout MUST be responsive, adapting to screen sizes from desktop to mobile.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
